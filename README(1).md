Cyberlog is a Flutter-based mobile application created to understand the foundations of cross-platform development. 
This project helped me explore the differences between native and cross-platform development, the role of hot reload in 
improving development speed, and the widget-based structure that forms the core of Flutter applications.

Native vs Cross-Platform Development
Native apps use platform-specific languages and toolchains (Kotlin/Android Studio and Swift/Xcode).
Cross-platform frameworks such as Flutter allow deployment to multiple platforms using a single codebase.

Hot Reload
Enables instant reflection of UI and logic changes without restarting the entire application.
Improves development efficiency and iteration speed.

Widgets
Every UI element in Flutter is a widget.
Understood the basics of StatelessWidget, MaterialApp, Scaffold, AppBar, and Text widgets.

Setup and Installation
1. Install Flutter
Download the Flutter SDK and extract it to a simple directory (e.g., C:\flutter).
Add its bin folder to the system PATH.

2. Verify Installation
Run: flutter doctor
Resolve all errors before proceeding.

3. Create the Project
flutter create cyberlog

4. Run the Application
cd cyberlog
flutter run
